# BST-autocorrect-project
• Created a spell check program which takes a full sentence as input and does a spell check on each word.
• The program provides 3 suggestions for each incorrect word using a dictionary which is stored in a Binary Search Tree.
• It provides the word's successor, predecessor and the leaf node as the 3 suggestions.
•Worked in a team of 2, the app was developed in C.
